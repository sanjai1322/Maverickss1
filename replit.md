# Overview

The Skill Assessment Platform "Mavericks" is a comprehensive agent-based coding platform that automates coding skill assessment, provides personalized learning paths, facilitates engaging hackathons, and offers full visibility into user progress. The platform uses a decomposed agent architecture with a central message bus, gamification features including leaderboards, and AI-powered agents for profile analysis, assessment generation, and learning path recommendations. Built with Flask and PostgreSQL for scalable, enterprise-ready skill development and monitoring.
